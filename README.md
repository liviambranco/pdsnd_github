### Description
This project explores data related to Motivate, a bike share system present in three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. It's goal is to answer critical questions about the business and uncover usage patterns within a user-friendly frame.
We will do that by importing the data provided by Motivate and writing code to compute descriptive statistics and answer the questions. We will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
- bikeshare.py
- chicago.csv
- washington.csv
- new_york_city.csv

### Software requirements
- Anaconda (with Python 3, NumPy, and Pandas installed)
